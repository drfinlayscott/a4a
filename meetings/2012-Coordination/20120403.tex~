\section{Introduction}
A number of issues required our attention and some planning. We need to progress or we may lose the momentum and end up not delivereing anything except a bunch of ideas.

The meeting was attended by Chato, Colin, Iago and Ernesto.

\section{2012 Plan}
The activities for 2012 are categorized in Invitations, Meetings, Courses, and Contracts. Regaring invitations we have already invited Henrik Gislason (DTU) and Richard Hillary (CSIRO). There's contacts with Steve Cadrin and Sidney Holt. There's another 2 invitations tha may realize. In summary we may have 4 invitations, taken around 10 days and with 2 travels from EU and 2 from USA. With regards to meetings there's the ICES WGMG and the ICES ASC. For the second is not clear how to fit a4a in the conference program. Courses for us (not given by us) were not foreseen in the beggining but there may be interest in a Julia course. Depending on how things progress the workshop to implement Fishrent+F3 in FLR may be funded by a4a. 

\section{KOM report}
The report is out and expecting comments. The final report will be delivered on the next few days.

\section{Data package}
The objective is to have a datasets package in FLR to support model's development and testing. The package will have real data, simulated data and some methods to introduce variability and generate indices of abundance.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Real data - It may be interesting to add datasets from ICES WG and get a full picture of a ergion, like the North Sea. Some tuna datasets already exist in FLExamples. [COLIN]  
	\item Simulated data - There are three collections that may be included.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Lenghth based data - Daniel Howell was already contacted to explore the possibility of using Gadget to simulate data. [ERNESTO]
		\item Age data from STECF HCR EWG -These datasets were used on a set of meetings dealing with HCR for CFP in 2009. The datasets need to be updated to recent FLR versions. The code is in sf.net. [IAGO]
		\item Age based data based on WKLIFE - This WK compiled a large number of life history parameters for EU stocks that require advise but none is given. Using the method gislasim, based on Henrik Gislason paper and Laurie's work, and some exploitation trends, it's possible to generate datasets for all these stocks. [ERNESTO]

\end{itemize}
