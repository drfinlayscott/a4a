\begin_layout Standard
The implementation of the 2009 revision of the DCF

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Data Collection Framework (2008/949/EC)
\end_layout

\end_inset

 generated the obligation to collect a large amount of information for all
 stocks being subject to fisheries exploitation.
 Based on the regulation there are 250+ stocks for which some kind of biological
 information must be collected.
 Most of these stocks will have in the future, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim$
\end_inset

2020, time series of exploitation data more than 10 years long, although
 the information about the biology will most likely be limited due to the
 logistics of processing all the samples collected.
 These stocks (will) have a moderate amount of information and won't fit
 into the "data poor" stock definition.
 In addition, due to the large number of these stocks it is not logistically
 feasible to run complex data eager models that require a high level of
 expertise to run and analyse.
 What is required is a robust methodology that allows the assessments of
 a large number of stocks by non-expert modellers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Having stock assessment and advisory methods to apply to a large number
 of moderate data stocks, raise interesting challenges and creates opportunities
 worth exploring.
 For example, approaching stock assessment as a data generating engine,
 having a common stock assessment methodology or analysing massive stock
 assessment results, open the possibility of issuing advise for more species
 in a multifleet, multispecies framework and promotes comparative advise
 analysis.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As scientists it is important to think ahead and start developing such methodolo
gies.
 JRC following it's mission of antecipating policy implementation issues
 decided to move forward with the

\begin_layout Subsection
Background information
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An introduction to the subject was done by Ernesto Jardim to open the meeting,
 followed by a set of presentations of reports and other initiatives, that
 contributed to the progress of the work.
 Manuela Azevedo presented the recent outcomes of the ICES WKLIFE (), the
 south hemisphere initiative on MSE report was presented by Iago Mosqueira,
 the GFCM workshop on Elasmobranchs was presented by Chato Osio and Andrew
 Cooper presented the management system implemented in the USA after the
 revision of the Stevenson-Magnunsson act.
 All these presentations are available on the a4a repository in github.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Outcomes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ToR and agenda were followed loosely to allow for discussions and brain
 storming.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The overall objective was to consolidate ideas regarding the initiative's
 aims, expectations and opeartionalization.
 It was critical to better define the problem the initiative is attempting
 to contribute to, discuss the range of solutions available and define which
 ones the initiative should pursue.
 In that sense the meeting was succefull and the objectives were achieved.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The discussions gave rise to the definition of a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

moderate data stock
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, a major step to understand where the initiative intends to contribute.
 The issue of introducing genetics in fisheries management was discussed
 and several clarifications were made, as well as the identification of
 promising areas of convergence between fisheries model ling and genetics.
 Another issue to be grounded was the assessment model(s) to be explored,
 for which a set of characteristics were defined while leaving open the
 exact framework to be used.
 A further step was taken by designing the type of Management Strategies
 Evaluation the initiative will promote/develop as a standard advise methodology
 for these kind of stocks.
 In a more pragmatic setting the group loosely defined a simulation experiment
 to be carried out and a set of subjects to be tested.
 Additionally the group discussed the a4a operationalization.

\begin_layout Standard
The group discussed the characteristics of a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

moderate data stock
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in terms of data availability and concluded on the following definition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A moderate data stock has at least data on:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
nominal effort, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
volume of catches in weight (which should include landings and discards),
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
length information for the catches (based on selectivity studies or direct
 observations),
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

 be a survey or CPUE),
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
length information for the index of abundance (based on selectivity studies
 or direct observations)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The length of the time series is not specified on purpose, it will depend
 on the species' longevity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Genetics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There were several doubts about how genetic analysis could contribute to
 fisheries management advise and stock dynamics modeling.
 To start with, a clear distinction must be made between the usage of genetics
 for enforcement, like determining the origin of individuals or species/stock
 mis-identification, from usage of genetic indicators or metrics for model
 ling purposes, which was the aim pursued in this meeting.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The discussions focused on three distinct themes: stock identification,
 risk indicators, and total biomass/abundance estimation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Stock identification is the most promising area of convergence, there's
 a number of examples where it's used and the genetic analysis behind it
 are stable and easy to perform.
 The major drawback is the need to establish a baseline, which depends on
 finding the alleles that separate the stocks/populations/groups.
 Better definitions of stock boundaries, estimates of migration rates, HCR
 based on the percentage of certain groups on the catch, etc, can all be
 plugged into stock dynamics model ling or management procedures simulations.
 Following these ideas the group discussed and suggested a non-exhaustive
 set of questions that could be tested on a MSE framework:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
What if there are two subpopulations with distinct biological characteristics
 managed as a single stock;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Which kind of HCR can be applied to a group of species based on knowledge
 of their percentage on the catch; 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
How robust is the management procedure to departures from the closed population
 stock assessment assumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Risk indicators were the next interesting subject that the group considered
 promising.
 If specific indicators, e.g.
 linked to specific biological functions like reproduction, are monitored
 over time it may give indications of something "wrong" going on.
 Such approach would require on-the-fly analysis and computations and a
 high time and spatial resolution.
 Other indicators that would fit this purpose are frequency of rare alleles
 which may work for endangered species, genetic diversity as an indicator
 of population resilience or reproductive success to indicate recruitment
 failure risk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With regards to estimations or proxies of stock biomass/abundance it was
 clear that genetics can not help.
 The concept of population size is very distinct and the relation between
 the genetic population size and abundance (number of individuals in the
 population) is similar to an exponential decay model where most abundance
 variability lies in the model's flat bottom (EINER AND ANDREW CAN YOU PLEASE
 CHECK THIS).
 For the moment it's useless to pursue such a path, in spite of the wide
 number of applications that could be followed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Time resolution is a major problem with genetic indicators which in most
 cases seem to be at a multi-annual scale.
 For stock and fisheries dynamics modeling that's too wide.
 On the other hand, a major advantage is that markers based on snips technology
 are easy to compare between laboratories and results are reproducible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Biomass model/stock assessment model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The assessment model has to be applied rapidly to a wide range of situations
 and provide quantitative results of abundance and fishing mortality.
 To achieve such objectives the model should not rely on human decisions
 and be adjusted as automatic as possible.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A simplified version may be used in the context of MSE, to inform the HCR
 during the management procedure.
 In fact there are two distinct processes that require an assessment model,
 each with distinct characteristics.
 The stock assessment model to condition the operating model must be as
 precise as possible, make use of all information available and provide
 estimates of the parameters uncertainty, while the stock assessment model
 to be used in the management procedure should be seen as a metric generator
 for the HCR, as simple and robust as possible, not neccessarely providing
 estimates of parameters' uncertainty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model should be based on existing models, avoid unneccessary complexity
 and implemented in FLR.
 One of the primary tasks of the initiative will be to test the assumptions
 of the model and derive it's characteristics.

it could be interpreted as a measure of the trade-off between implementation
 error and observation-estimation error.
 Being close to 1 could be interpreted as errors being compensated and being
 able to manage “well” the system.
 The clear disadvantage is that it is not symmetric: goes in (0,1) in one
 side and (1,infinity) on the other.
